# DevTools

**DevTools** is a GUI-based collection of utilities and code snippets designed for offline use. The goal of the project is to provide a secure environment where users can perform various development-related tasks without having to visit external websites or risk sharing sensitive data. DevTools is built using Rust and the [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) library.

> **Note:** This project is still a **work in progress** and I am using it as a Pet Project to learn Rust.

## Features

- **UUID Generator**: Generate UUID.
- **JSON Beautifier**: Format a JSON string.

More tools and utilities will be added as the project progresses!
